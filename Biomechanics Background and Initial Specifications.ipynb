    "In this paper, the computed tomography has enabled a 3d visualization of the sling-jaw wrasse's deployment mechanism. More specifically, it showed why this mechanism is seen in relatively small fishes compared to big fishes. This highly efficient linear deployment could be used in any application where moving the overall robot could appear more energy costly. The paper also focuses on the jaw mechanism's numerical model, which gives us critical information for our initial specifications. This paper proves the efficiency in the adoption of the Sling-jaw wrasse system to capture prey. The energy used by the fish's jaw is 97.9%  less than the energy required to move the fish of the same distance.\n",

    "In this paper, there is an in-depth analysis of the difference between 3 different but similar fish species that share the jaw movement found in the sling-jaw wrasse.  In particular, the forces and speeds required by each fish were found to be significantly different. It was also noted that the Jaw movements, gape, gape angle, and protrusion differed between the three species.  These differences were found to be significant compared to the scale of the body. This paper clearly describes each fish's kinematic variables during feeding, giving detailed information about body position and behavior. Figure 4C has discussed the distance that the jaw protrudes forward to the prey, which establishes that the Epibulus Insidiator benefits the most from its jaw design.

    "This paper proposes a robot hand structure with improved features (four-bar linkage mechanism) to overcome the deficiency of using the cable-driven actuated mechanism that leads to less structure durability and inaccurate motion range. This proposed robot hand structure also took into account the existing design problems such as bulky structure, non-individual actuated finger, incomplete fingers and a lack of finger joints compared to the actual finger in its design. This paper presents the improvements achieved by applying the proposed design such as the use of a four-bar linkage mechanism instead of using the cable-driven mechanism, the size of an average human hand, five-fingers with completed joints where each finger is moved by motor individually, joint protection using a mechanical stopper, detachable finger structure from the palm frame, a structure that has sufficient durability for everyday use and an easy to fabricate structure using 3D printing technology. This paper also provides a detailed account of the Materials used, design specifications (Fig 3 & Fig 4) and the electric & electronic system (Fig 12) of the robot.\n",

    "This paper presents a four bar linkage mechanism used in the design and implementation of a gripper. This paper focuses on minimizing the weight, grasping the object securely, gripping multiple objects with a single gripper, not deforming the object while gripping and designing for the proper grippe-object interaction. The gripper developed was configured with a four bar linkage design for its wide applications and utilization of minimum workspace. The gripper consists of four rectangular aluminum flats arranged according to a four bar linkage gripper configuration. The fingers are flat and rectangular in shape. The base of the gripper was made of a rectangular aluminum bar for light weight consideration to ease machining. Holes are made in the bar for fitting the bearings. The gripper is guided by using a worm and spur gear arrangement to convert the rotational motion to linear motion. To control gripping of objects, two standard round commercial force sensors are used. These are force sensor resistor (FSR) type sensors with Flexi-force model 402 working in the range of 10gm to 1kg (0.1N– 10N), and are used to measure the applied force. Another standard commercial square force sensor resistor FSR (Flexi-force model 406 working in the range of 10g to 1kg (0.1N– 10N)) as shown in Figure 2, is used to measure the initial weight of the object that is to be gripped. These three sensors are tactile sensors. The actuator used to drive the four-bar linkage gripper is a permanent magnet dc motor of 10rpm, 2A 12 V rating. An Atmega 16 Board manufactured by Extreme Electronics, Inc. is used to control the actuation required. Figure 3 shows the items used. The design of the gripper has been made taking into some restrictions as long fingers require high torque, and short fingers impose restrictions on object dimensions. Hence bars are selected as per suitable dimensions for the construction of the gripper. A deformable complaint rubber material is used at the face of the fingers that come in contact with the workpiece, so as to decrease the pressure to apply on the object, increase interface friction, and avoid deformation from the uneven application of force.  The paper also describes an equation(equation 1) to calculate the torque required for gripping the object.The paper also demonstrates the force sensor calibration.\n",

With this assumption, and knowing the relationship between force and acceleration, and power and force and speed. We are able to estimate the power consumption profile shown in the following figure.\n",

    "The key features of the jaw movement of the slingjaw wrasse can be easily replicated. The mechanism that is used by the jaw of the slingjaw wrasse is similar to that of a four bar mechanism. The fish can extend its jaws up to 65% the length of its head. The largest specimens of this fish may attain a standard length of 21 inches. Based on the data from the above citations the jaw reaching distance can range from 30 mm-45 mm. Judging by the relative small size of the animal, all the key mechanical features required for the mechanical motion of the robot can be easily replicated.  Affordable servo motors can be used to initiate the actual movement of the bars of the four bar mechanism and initiate the movement of actuators. The electrical and electronic control can be achieved by utilizing electronic circuit boards from Arduino. We are yet to decide on the material to be used for the robotic arm and at this moment we are going through our options for the most affordable and appropriate material for the robotic arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find a motor and battery that can supply the mechanical power needs obtained above. Consider that motor efficiencies may be as high as 95%, but if you can’t find it listed, assume you find a more affordable motor at 50-70% efficiency. Compare the mechanical watts/kg for the necessary motor and battery vs the animal’s mechanical power/mass above? Which one is more energy dense?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider a DFRobot FIT0492-A motor which weighs 210.01 g with a torque rating of 883mNm. The diameter of the shaft is 6.00 mm. So the force that can be generated by the motor is 883/3= 294.3mN. Considering the motor efficiency is at 95%, the force generated by the motor will be 279mN. The mechanical power will be approximately 7 watts. Let us calculate the mechanical power/mass for just the motor: 279mNm/210g = 1.32N/kg. If we consider the mass of the battery then the mechanical watts/kg for both the motor and battery will be less than 1.32N/Kg. The mechanical power[4]/mass[3] of the slingjaw wrasse is approximately 0.257/100g =2.57N/Kg. Based on the calculations the slingjaw wrasse is more energy dense. \n",
